# Shape Battle Demo Project

A simple battle demonstrating a gameplay mechanic implemented with godot. The player takes control of 3 characters:
- Square: mage like, has **icewall (ground target)** and **firewall (single target)**
- Circle: healer like, has **heal (single target)** and **swap position (single target)**
- Triangle: warrior like, has **dash slash (single target)** and **double slash (single target)**

You will be fighting a boss (let's call it diamond) that has the following attacks:
- Meteor (ground target, large area)
- Spikes (no target, random spikes appear on the ground)
- Lazer (ground target, reaches from the boss to the end of the screen)
